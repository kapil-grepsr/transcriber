32.52211,32.64219, For
32.70223,33.06247," instance,"
33.12252,33.5428, lithium
34.32333,34.50345, is

41.16795,41.28803, They
41.34807,41.528189999999995, also

60.40041,60.7607, Atomic
60.86078,61.20106, radius
61.30114,61.92164, increases

62.341989999999996,62.622209999999995, left.
64.86404,64.98413, So
65.78478,66.22514, sodium
67.42612,67.62628, is
67.82644,68.24679, larger

73.37095,73.95142, increases.
75.43263,75.55273, So
75.65281,75.93303, alkali
75.97307,76.27331, metals
76.29333,76.41343, they

96.88675,97.00683000000001, so
97.02684,97.14692000000001, that
97.18695000000001,97.38709, means

105.45254,105.59263000000001, Now
105.6927,106.07295, alkaline
106.07295,106.4332, metals
106.59331,106.75341, are
